<p>There's an expectation from every developer nowadays. These are the set of tools that you require to get started before jumping into a project.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-version-control">Setting up version control</h2>
<p>Any company immediately checks whether you have a Github account; it's like a developer's business card. Once you have created your account, give your GitHub handle to your Technical Lead so he can add you to the company's team account. Learn the concepts of git like <code>clone</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>branches</code>, <code>merge</code>, <code>rebase</code> and <code>pull requests</code></p>
<p>Please learn the concepts of Git <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/">Git tutorials</a></p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a professional GitHub handle, please don't use "Hammerplay" name in it; Even after you leave the company, you still want to continue using that account.</li>
<li>Do not work on the main branch right after you create a repository. After you either add README.md or .gitignore, Create a <strong>develop</strong> branch and push your code in that branch.</li>
<li>Plan your .gitignore from start or copy it from an other project. Folders like <strong>Builds</strong> should be ignored from the beginning. Try to avoid commiting files then try to ignore it later.</li>
<li>Do not keep your project files inside sub-folders. For example, Unity project should have <strong>Assets</strong> in the root of the git folder.</li>
<li>Keep your projects organized in one <strong>projects</strong> folder.</li>
<li>Naming conventions are crucial, we will cover more on that in best practices. Root git folder name should be in lowercases and use '-' as space. For example <strong>sheep-battle</strong>.</li>
<li>When working with binary files like your <strong>images, sounds, textures, and scenes</strong>; Communicate with the other team members, other wise you'll be stepping toes during git merge and losing data.</li>
<li>Make smaller commits or follow <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/desktop-gui/advanced-topics/git-flow/">git-flow</a> method.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>Teamwork is essential at Hammerplay; we follow Agile methodologies (mostly). To simplify the concepts, we do not have project managers, which means we have to communicate with the rest of the team by ourselves. If you need an asset? You either need to talk with your producer or talk directly with the artist/developer.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-ideas-form-and-who-makes-the-call">How do ideas form and who makes the call?!</h3>
<p>Scrum/floor discussion, we talk about what we want to achieve and what the project ideas are, then we vote on the ideas as a group and make a list and try to go by that list. It's messy, but it works best with creative projects.</p>
<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>
<p>Once the project is discussed each of the teammates comes up with estimates on how long it'll take, and further break down these milestones as <strong>prototype, alpha, internal beta, public beta, and release</strong>, there are no work timings, we just expect the milestones to be done with the estimates that you have already given. Sometimes estimates could be off, please raise a flag if things are not going by your timelines and talk to your team for updated action plans. Sync up with your team at least two times a week.</p>
<h3 id="emails-slack-whatsapp">Emails? Slack? WhatsApp?</h3>
<p><strong>Mails</strong>: Only use for official talks, like talking to a client, even though most clients jump on Slack channels nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong>: Avoid project discussions here unless you want to notify someone who is not reachable by Slack. You can say <em>"you're not coming for work"</em>, or <em>"you'll be late"</em> or just share memes.</p>
<p><strong>Slack</strong>: Post pandemic, Slack has completely changed how we work at our office. And moving forward, we'll be using this method regardless. Projects are usually in each channel, so keep your project discussions inside that channel and don't bother people on direct messaging unless it's private.</p>
<p><strong>Floor</strong>: Floor talk is the easiest form so far, this is best for us to do iterations, like going through assets or check game mechanics.<strong>Caution: You could be disturbing/distracting them from doing their work. Respect people's space and timings.</strong></p>
<h2 id="workspace">Workspace</h2>
<p>Write about office stuff, lunch, theatre room, devices/office assets checked out of office..etc Work timings, code of conduct</p>
